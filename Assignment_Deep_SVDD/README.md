# Assignment : Deep SVDD
## Deep Support Vector Data Description for Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection

## Introduction
In doing this assignment I have implemented the algorithm given in [1] i.e. deep support vector data description for anomaly detection, on MNIST dataset for detecting outliers and differentiating them from inliers.
